Travel recaps need momentum, but viewers still need to understand where you went.

Use this simple speed framework:

- **1.0x - 1.4x** for orientation sections.
- **1.6x - 2.2x** for transitions between cities.
- **0.8x - 1.2x** for emotional highlights.

If your narration includes place names, slow down route playback just before each mention.
