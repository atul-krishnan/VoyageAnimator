Before final export, verify:

1. Start and end locations are visible for at least one beat.
2. Route direction is obvious at all transitions.
3. Marker orientation matches movement.
4. Text overlays never collide with route focal points.
5. Playback speed supports narration rhythm.

These checks improve retention and perceived production quality.
