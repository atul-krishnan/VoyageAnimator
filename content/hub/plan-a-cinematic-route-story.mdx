Most travel creators lose time when map animation starts too early in the production process.

A better workflow is to lock your narrative beats first:

1. Start point and context frame.
2. The transitions that matter emotionally.
3. The final destination or reveal.

In Voyagraph, create route points only for those beats first. Then fill in intermediate legs after pacing looks right.

This keeps map movement connected to story, not just geography.
