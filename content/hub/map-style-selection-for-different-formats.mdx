Different content formats demand different map contrast.

For short-form vertical content, high-contrast styles with bolder route lines perform best.

For long-form YouTube edits, calmer base styles reduce visual fatigue and keep attention on narration.

Build presets for each format so you can swap quickly while keeping the same route geometry.
